# React Native Authentication Boilerplate

This is an example app that implements [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) Authentication to a [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) app.

Currently, this version doesn't have OAuth implemented.

## Usage Instructions

```bash
# Clone repo and install dependencies
git clone git@github.com:ultimagriever/react-native-firebase-auth.git
cd react-native-firebase-auth
npm install

# Run app on iOS simulator - must have Xcode installed
react-native run-ios

# Run app on Android emulator - must have Android Studio installed
react-native run-android
```

If you wish so, you can add your own Firebase credentials to your app and test it away.
